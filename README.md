### Description

VB PhotoShop clone. Various image effects - rotation, flip, fade, color manipulation, fish-eye,swirle etc plus various filters - soften/sharpen/custom etc. A lot of undocumented staff including using MSOffice graphic convertion filters, pure VB calling dll functions by its pointers, assembly language inside VB and much more!
 
### More Info
 
Note: running code from IDE is slow, but if compile into native code with Fast optimization and checking all check boxes in advanced tab, it run almost as fast as commercial/C++ products. Code tested on w98/IE5.0/MSOffice_97. Since I used a lot of undocumented staff, some functions may not work on newer platforms.
